# Forensic Analysis of Cyber Attacks Using Cowrie Honeypot and Python

## Project Overview
This project deploys a **Cowrie honeypot** on a local machine to simulate SSH/Telnet attacks and collect attack data. A custom Python forensic analyzer parses logs, generates visualizations, detects anomalies, and produces PDF reports. Additionally, a fake attack simulator populates the honeypot logs with realistic attacker IPs, credentials, and commands for testing purposes.

This setup provides a practical lab for studying attack patterns, understanding attacker behavior, and testing cybersecurity tools.

---

## Features
- Local deployment of Cowrie honeypot on port 2222
- Log parsing (`log_parser.py`)
- Visualization of attacks (`graphs.py`)
- Geolocation mapping of attacker IPs (`geoip_map.py`)
- Real-time monitoring (`real_time_monitor.py`)
- Anomaly detection using ML (`ml_anomaly.py`)
- Fake attack generator (`fake_cowrie_attacks.py`)
- PDF report generation (`report_generator.py`)

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Cowrie Honeypot** – for SSH/Telnet simulation
- **Python Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, watchdog, scikit-learn, folium, reportlab
- **GeoLite2** – for attacker IP geolocation
- **JSON logs** – generated by Cowrie

**Directory Structure**
```
forensic_project/
├─ main.py # Entry point; orchestrates everything
├─ log_parser.py # Parses logs and creates DataFrames
├─ real_time_monitor.py # Real-time monitoring and alerts
├─ ml_anomaly.py # ML-based anomaly detection
├─ geo_visualization.py # IP geolocation and map generation
├─ report_generator.py # PDF/HTML report generation
├─ dashboard_app.py # Streamlit dashboard
├─ requirements.txt # Python dependencies
├─ forensic_report.pdf # Generated PDF report
└─ attack_map.html # Generated attack map
```
**Additional files generated during analysis:**  
- `top_ips.png`, `top_credentials.png`, `top_commands.png`, `attack_by_hour.png`  
- `fake_attacks.py` for simulating attacks

---

## Usage
**Run the main orchestration script:**

python main.py

**What happens when you run main.py:**
- Parses Cowrie logs (log_parser.py)
- Generates visualizations (graphs.py, geo_visualization.py)
- Creates geolocation map (attack_map.html)
- Runs real-time monitoring (real_time_monitor.py)
- Performs anomaly detection (ml_anomaly.py)
- Generates PDF forensic report (forensic_report.pdf)
- **Simulate attacks:**
  
  python fake_attacks.py

---

## Results
- Tables and charts of top attacker IPs
- Most attempted username/password combinations
- Commands executed by attackers
- GeoIP maps showing attacker locations
- Summary PDF report

---

## Future Enhancements
- Deploy honeypot on a VPS to capture real-world attacks
- Integrate live threat intelligence feeds like AbuseIPDB
- Add automated alerting via email or dashboard for detected attacks
- Expand anomaly detection with advanced machine learning models
- Support multiple types of honeypots for broader attack coverage
